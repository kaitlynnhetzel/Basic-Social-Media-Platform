Project 01

Hello! There are a few things to note about the project
1) In the client  class, the entry for the file to use to run the client is listed as
	"datafile.txt". If you want to enter your own file, enter it there. Otherwise
	the program will create a new blank file under that name.
2) I was absolutely unable to work the contain() method of the SimpleStack class. I could not
	find a way to compare generic objects. The method is still there, and every thing compiles
	but this means that the friendlist that the profile object has can and will hold multiple
	identical profiles. I tried for hours to get the .equals() method to work in different capacities,
	but to no avail.
3) This also means that recommend() will sometimes recommend a profile that the user already follows
4)I also was a little unsure as to how each of the Profile editing methods were supposed to be carried out, 
	so I made the user do all changes (i.e. edit a profile object's name/about with the edit() method) on the command line.

Other than that, everything should work almost perfectly. 


Thank you for your time!
